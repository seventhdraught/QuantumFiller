very rudimentary quantum(VQLS) vs classical algorithm example for a gradient missing pixels
This project is our take on the Advanced Quantum Track problem of using a quantum algorithm to solve Ax=b. The idea behind it is to create an Ax=b matrix system from missing pixels in images and have items in x be the color value of the pixel corresponding to that vector item. We did show this in the classical solution which solved 2 missing pixels in a gradient image by using a numpy method to solve x = A^-1*b. While we did show a different Ax=b matrix solution done by the quantum algorithm, if the quantum algorithm VQLS was properly represented using the same gradient, and then extrapolated for x, it would be very similar to the classical solution but perhaps slightly off. For a small 8x8 matrix like this, the quantum algorithm would be overkill and the classical algorithm would outperform it, but the idea behind showing this example was to show that VQLS could be used to repair missing pixels in images (due to its property of being able to solve for a matrix equation) rather than using a classical solution. This is good because images can scale up to millions of pixels easily, and using a normal solution would take an enormous amount of time. A quantum algorithm would take a lot less time than a normal solution albeit would still be slow currently due to current computers not handling qubits well. In the future quantum algorithms will definitely be much better off compared to classical solutions in regards to, say repairing a movie just because of the time complexity advantage it has due to utilizing superposition.
